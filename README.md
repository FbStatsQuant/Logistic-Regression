# Logistic Regression — Python Practice

A hands-on repository dedicated to learning and practicing **Logistic Regression** through real-world binary and multiclass classification problems using Python.

## What This Repo Is About

Logistic Regression is one of the most fundamental and interpretable algorithms in machine learning. Despite its simplicity, it's a powerful tool when applied correctly — and understanding it deeply is essential before moving on to more complex models.

This repo documents a structured practice journey: not just fitting models, but understanding *why* they work, *when* they fail, and *how* to evaluate them properly.

## What We Cover

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Dealing with imbalanced classes

### Model Building
- Training Logistic Regression models with `scikit-learn`
- Tuning regularization (L1, L2, ElasticNet)
- Adjusting decision thresholds
- Multiclass strategies (One-vs-Rest, Softmax)

### Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC Curve and AUC
- Precision-Recall Curve (especially for imbalanced data)

### Interpretation
- Understanding model coefficients
- Feature importance and odds ratios
- Decision boundary visualization

## Goal

By the end of this practice, the objective is to have a solid, practical understanding of Logistic Regression — not just how to run it, but how to apply it thoughtfully in real classification scenarios.
